Parting the curtains on this world, media professor Roger Stahl engages an array of other stunned scholars, frustrated veterans, PR insiders, and industry producers. Stahl reveals in unsettling detail how the US military-industrial complex pushes a version of history that scrubs the screen of war crimes, corruption, criticism of the nuclear arsenal, racism, sexual assault, assassinations, and torture.

The golden-haired, soft-spoken Australian heartthrob who starred in the late 90s/early 00s hits like Ten Things I Hate About You and A Knight's Tale. He moved on to more serious roles, like his Academy Award-nominated performance in Brokeback Mountain and his Oscar-winning performance as the Joker in Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' in 2008. He was nominated for the BAFTA Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Actor, becoming the eighth-youngest nominee in the category at that time. However, the real story of Heath Ledger's life is far more tragic than anyone suspected. From his parents' divorce to the endless rumours about troubling behaviour, the press became more and more obsessed with the star as his fame grew. His depression, crippling insomnia, and constant partying caused an addiction to drugs. A fatal addiction that would eventually take his life.","primaryImage":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MWEwOTQtZTdlOS00OTJhLWFkZDEtODAyMGFkMTI4YjljXkEyXkFqcGc@.jpg","thumbnails":[{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MWEwOTQtZTdlOS00OTJhLWFkZDEtODAyMGFkMTI4YjljXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX100_CR0,0,100,148_.jpg","width":100,"height":148},{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MWEwOTQtZTdlOS00OTJhLWFkZDEtODAyMGFkMTI4YjljXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX280_CR0,0,280,414_.jpg","width":280,"height":414},{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MWEwOTQtZTdlOS00OTJhLWFkZDEtODAyMGFkMTI4YjljXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,0,380,562_.jpg","width":380,"height":562}],"trailer":null,"contentRating":null,"isAdult":false,"releaseDate":null,"startYear":2023,"endYear":null,"runtimeMinutes":54,"genres":["Documentary"],"interests":["Documentary"],"countriesOfOrigin":["GB"],"externalLinks":["https://www.entertainmeuk.com/"],"spokenLanguages":["en"],"filmingLocations":null,"productionCompanies":[{"id":"co0837272","name":"Entertain Me Productions"}],"budget":100000,"grossWorldwide":null,"averageRating":7.6,"numVotes":10,"metascore":null},{"id":"tt23474764","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt23474764/","primaryTitle":"Harry Styles: The Finishing Touch","originalTitle":"Harry Styles: The Finishing Touch","type":"movie","description":"Hit after hit, pop-icon Harry Styles, once the centerpiece of the world's biggest boy bands has grown into someone who isn't afraid of self-expression, continuing to reject the traditional confines of masculinity.","primaryImage":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIzMDRkMjktOTMyOC00NDlkLTk3ZDMtZWZjYmQ0OTRmNjhmXkEyXkFqcGc@.jpg","thumbnails":[{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIzMDRkMjktOTMyOC00NDlkLTk3ZDMtZWZjYmQ0OTRmNjhmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX100_CR0,0,100,148_.jpg","width":100,"height":148},{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIzMDRkMjktOTMyOC00NDlkLTk3ZDMtZWZjYmQ0OTRmNjhmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX280_CR0,0,280,414_.jpg","width":280,"height":414},{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIzMDRkMjktOTMyOC00NDlkLTk3ZDMtZWZjYmQ0OTRmNjhmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,0,380,562_.jpg","width":380,"height":562}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTnMVLZfPoE","contentRating":null,"isAdult":false,"releaseDate":"2023-12-04","startYear":2023,"endYear":null,"runtimeMinutes":54,"genres":["Biography","Documentary","Music"],"interests":["Biography","Documentary","Music"],"countriesOfOrigin":["GB"],"externalLinks":null,"spokenLanguages":["en"],"filmingLocations":null,"productionCompanies":[{"id":"co0837272","name":"Entertain Me Productions"}],"budget":100000,"grossWorldwide":null,"averageRating":5.3,"numVotes":76,"metascore":null},{"id":"tt32094957","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32094957/","primaryTitle":"WB 100th Behind the Shield","originalTitle":"WB 100th Behind the Shield","type":"tvMiniSeries","description":"WB 100th Behind the Shield includes 17 short features that explore the rich history of Warner Bros. with profiles on filmmakers and TV creators such as Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, Jon M.

The irony of Hollywood fabricating a race riot for the sake of A Time to Kill provides a framework for presenting the complexity of race relations in a historically troubled region. Less than a year prior to filming, National Guardsmen were alerted to the possibility of actual race rioting in the town square, during federally monitored run-off election. Using footage of the movie production, scenes from the 1996 local premiere in Jackson, film clips, and interviews with writer John Grisham, director Joel Shumacher, actor Samuel Jackson and members of the film crew, we investigate the temporary and permanent effects of Hollywood's takeover of Canton. Local residents relate their personal experiences as extras and comment on the impact of the racially charged blockbuster. We incorporate local and national media coverage of the production, placing special emphasis on the commercial negotiations of the town's history.","primaryImage":null,"thumbnails":[],"trailer":null,"contentRating":null,"isAdult":false,"releaseDate":"1998-06-08","startYear":1998,"endYear":null,"runtimeMinutes":60,"genres":["Documentary","History"],"interests":["Documentary","History"],"countriesOfOrigin":["US"],"externalLinks":null,"spokenLanguages":["en"],"filmingLocations":["Canton, Mississippi, USA"],"productionCompanies":[],"budget":30000,"grossWorldwide":null,"averageRating":7.3,"numVotes":20,"metascore":null},{"id":"tt0773260","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0773260/","primaryTitle":"Bravo Profiles: The Entertainment Business","originalTitle":"Bravo Profiles: The Entertainment Business","type":"tvMiniSeries","description":"It essentially peers through a microscope at celebrity culture in general, at the film industry and its marketing might.","primaryImage":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjRmOTA2YjctZTg0MS00NjhlLTgwYjQtNTJjOGM3NzE5OWZhXkEyXkFqcGc@.jpg","thumbnails":[{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjRmOTA2YjctZTg0MS00NjhlLTgwYjQtNTJjOGM3NzE5OWZhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX100_CR0,0,100,148_.jpg","width":100,"height":148},{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjRmOTA2YjctZTg0MS00NjhlLTgwYjQtNTJjOGM3NzE5OWZhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX280_CR0,0,280,414_.jpg","width":280,"height":414},{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjRmOTA2YjctZTg0MS00NjhlLTgwYjQtNTJjOGM3NzE5OWZhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,0,380,562_.jpg","width":380,"height":562}],"trailer":null,"contentRating":null,"isAdult":false,"releaseDate":"1998-03-01","startYear":1998,"endYear":1998,"runtimeMinutes":null,"genres":["Documentary"],"interests":["Documentary"],"countriesOfOrigin":["US"],"externalLinks":null,"spokenLanguages":["en"],"filmingLocations":null,"productionCompanies":[],"budget":null,"grossWorldwide":null,"averageRating":6.4,"numVotes":126,"metascore":null},{"id":"tt0120769","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120769/","primaryTitle":"The Newton Boys","originalTitle":"The Newton Boys","type":"movie","description":"The story of the Newton gang, the most successful bank robbers in history, owing to their good planning and minimal violence.","primaryImage":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwN2Y4ODgtM2IxZS00MDg4LThhOTEtMzE1YjFlYjljZGY0XkEyXkFqcGc@.jpg","thumbnails":[{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwN2Y4ODgtM2IxZS00MDg4LThhOTEtMzE1YjFlYjljZGY0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX100_CR0,0,100,148_.jpg","width":100,"height":148},{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwN2Y4ODgtM2IxZS00MDg4LThhOTEtMzE1YjFlYjljZGY0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX280_CR0,0,280,414_.jpg","width":280,"height":414},{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwN2Y4ODgtM2IxZS00MDg4LThhOTEtMzE1YjFlYjljZGY0XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,0,380,562_.jpg","width":380,"height":562}],"trailer":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJDYrGDE0Ww","contentRating":"PG-13","isAdult":false,"releaseDate":"1998-03-27","startYear":1998,"endYear":null,"runtimeMinutes":122,"genres":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"interests":["Heist","True Crime","Action","Crime","Drama","History","Western"],"countriesOfOrigin":["US"],"externalLinks":null,"spokenLanguages":["en"],"filmingLocations":["San Antonio, Texas, USA"],"productionCompanies":[{"id":"co0000756","name":"Twentieth Century Fox"},{"id":"co0123642","name":"Detour Filmproduction"},{"id":"co0014799","name":"Newton Boys Ventures"}],"budget":27000000,"grossWorldwide":10452012,"averageRating":6.1,"numVotes":13028,"metascore":57},{"id":"tt0118607","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118607/","primaryTitle":"Amistad","originalTitle":"Amistad","type":"movie","description":"In 1839, the revolt of Mende captives aboard a Spanish owned ship causes a major controversy in the United States when the ship is captured off the coast of Long Island.

A's with Academy Award winner Quentin Tarantino and close associates reveal the final act of his life. In his own words, Burt explains himself, his career, success, secret passions and advice for others. This no holds-barred interview with \"The Last Movie Star\" at his Florida acting school, filmed just before his untimely death, is considered by friends to have captured the real Reynolds. Initially scheduled as a brief discussion for a documentary about film financing, which he claimed to know nothing about, he was irritable and edgy, rambled around a bit, eventually settled down and engaged in a rare in-depth look back at his passions and purpose, plans for the future and a wide range of topics. Opinionated, outspoken, charismatic, glib, charming and funny, Reynolds delivers a startling, unsettling, heartbreaking, up-close view of a cinema and Hollywood box-office legend who remains larger than life.","primaryImage":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGUxMDA1YTctNjI2NS00MmNiLWExMGYtODMxMDBlZTQ2MjBjXkEyXkFqcGc@.jpg","thumbnails":[{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGUxMDA1YTctNjI2NS00MmNiLWExMGYtODMxMDBlZTQ2MjBjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX100_CR0,0,100,148_.jpg","width":100,"height":148},{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGUxMDA1YTctNjI2NS00MmNiLWExMGYtODMxMDBlZTQ2MjBjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX280_CR0,0,280,414_.jpg","width":280,"height":414},{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGUxMDA1YTctNjI2NS00MmNiLWExMGYtODMxMDBlZTQ2MjBjXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,0,380,562_.jpg","width":380,"height":562}],"trailer":null,"contentRating":null,"isAdult":false,"releaseDate":"2023-11-14","startYear":2023,"endYear":null,"runtimeMinutes":99,"genres":["Documentary"],"interests":["Documentary"],"countriesOfOrigin":["US"],"externalLinks":["http://www.MovieMoney.com/"],"spokenLanguages":["en"],"filmingLocations":["Palm

The show tries to answer mysteries and certain queries within diverse fields like the human mind, history, archaeology, medicine, anthropology, nature, biology, space and history. While the show was being planned, Discovery's game-plan was to air twelve one-hour episodes each season for five years. However, when \"Curiosity...\" did premiere in August of 2011, it began a weekly broadcast schedule that ran the full first season, which ended with the 13th episode on November, 20, 2011. Similarly, the second season also followed the weekly format, between October 7, 2012 and January 27, 2013. Since then, there has only been one episode broadcast under the umbrella title of \"Curiosity: The Questions of Our Life\". This was the episode named \"Stonehenge\", which was shown on July 20, 2014. Two websites have emerged since the series debut, both of which deal with analogous subject matter, which achieve their individual goals strategically.","primaryImage":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzBjZjEzODktYzc4MC00NTQ1LWIwOWQtODI3YzZhZjQyNjIwXkEyXkFqcGc@.jpg","thumbnails":[{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzBjZjEzODktYzc4MC00NTQ1LWIwOWQtODI3YzZhZjQyNjIwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX100_CR0,0,100,148_.jpg","width":100,"height":148},{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzBjZjEzODktYzc4MC00NTQ1LWIwOWQtODI3YzZhZjQyNjIwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX280_CR0,0,280,414_.jpg","width":280,"height":414},{"url":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzBjZjEzODktYzc4MC00NTQ1LWIwOWQtODI3YzZhZjQyNjIwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_QL75_UX380_CR0,0,380,562_.jpg","width":380,"height":562}],"trailer":null,"contentRating":"TV-PG","isAdult":false,"releaseDate":"2011-08-07","startYear":2011,"endYear":2014,"runtimeMinutes":null,"genres":["Documentary"],"interests":["Documentary"],"countriesOfOrigin":["US","GB","FR","DE","CA","ZA"],"externalLinks":["http://curiosity.discovery.com/group/curiosity/about"],"spokenLanguages":["en"],"filmingLocations":null,"productionCompanies":[{"id":"co0000130","name":"Darlow Smithson Productions"},{"id":"co0045277","name":"Discovery Channel"},{"id":"co0145628","name":"Baltic Film Services"}],"budget":null,"grossWorldwide":null,"averageRating":7.6,"numVotes":750,"metascore":null},{"id":"tt1564349","url":"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1564349/","primaryTitle":"Dolphin Tale","originalTitle":"Dolphin Tale","type":"movie","description":"A boy finds a dolphin that was injured in a trap.
